# Example1

This is a Sample application demonstrating the use of spring boot
to define a restfull webservice. The resource exposed takes a range defined by
a "start" and "end" integer, converting it to an integer stream, applying some processing logic to convert to a map
where the key is the integer and the value is the output of the processing logic applied to that
number.

The main method is defined in ExampleMain.
